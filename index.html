					<h2>Tailored learning for children and adults</h2>
				</header>
				<section>
					<p>I am a fully qualified teacher with a huge experience in providing quality learning opportunities for individuals of all ages. Having taught for many years in different schools across the country as well as an adult learning centre I am adept at providing engaging lessons for all abilities that promote progress, confidence and self-esteem. For the last 4 years I have been providing private 1:1 tutoring in a variety of subjects. Much of my tuition has been requested by clients for an extended period as well as for different children in the same family. Tuition takes place in my own home to enable me to make the best use of a wide range of resources as well as outdoor learning opportunities for younger pupils.</p>
					
					<p>The aim of my lessons is to promote learning and progression by building confidence through success and encouraging a ‘can do’ approach to learning. I plan tailored sessions specific to the needs of the individual which are interactive, enjoyable and fun.</p>
					
					<p>I love to teach and have had much success with the individuals with whom I work. If you are looking for an enthusiastic teacher who will do their very best to help you or your child achieve their goals then please contact me.</p>

						<p class="js-testimonial-text testimonial-text testimonial-text-hide">"My son worked with Leigh for 5 months prior to taking his GCSE English. After just one session his confidence greatly improved and after a few more lessons I noticed a huge improvement in his understanding of the subject and quality of his work. I am so grateful that Leigh agreed to work with him as she has had a massive impact and has given him all the tools and strategies necessary to sit his exams knowing he could achieve good results. Ben thoroughly enjoyed working with Leigh and her patience and positive attitude has made him believe in himself. I would highly recommend Leigh to any parent with concerns regarding their child’s attainment." - Theresa P</p>

						<p class="js-testimonial-text testimonial-text testimonial-text-hide">"Leigh’s warmth and encouragement have done wonders for Callum’s confidence. She’s got a really good understanding of what makes him tick as well as what he needs help with so he enjoys his time with her and is motivated by the activities she does with him. The most important change I’ve noticed is in his attitude to learning which is so much more positive." - Ruth E</p>

						<p class="js-testimonial-text testimonial-text testimonial-text-hide">"My two daughters (6 and 11) have been tutored by Leigh for over a year now and it has made such a difference. When Emily needed an extra hour Leigh made sure she could do that. Emily’s confidence/knowledge has improved especially in completing homework and she is a lot happier in her school life. The girls are always happy to see Leigh as she makes learning fun. Leigh is part of the girls’ life now and I hope will be for a long time. I am so happy they have her. I would recommend Leigh." - Lucy T</p>

						<p class="js-testimonial-text testimonial-text testimonial-text-hide">"Leigh is very friendly and warm. Gabriel enjoyed his lessons. Her lessons were planned appropriately and very much directed towards his ability. Leigh spent time assessing Gabriel's specific needs to enable her lessons to target his weaknesses. Gabriel is growing in confidence at school as a result of Leigh's endeavours. Gabriel has enjoyed working with Leigh. She explains problems in a way he understands and gives him time to think about answers, always praising his efforts. I would highly recommend Leigh to anyone who is looking for a tutor." - Rachel M</p>
